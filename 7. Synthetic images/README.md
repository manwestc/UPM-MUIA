## TensorFlow - Keras Notebooks - Examples

This folder contains the examples on how to run TINTOlib in any Python environment. 

For this purpose, 3 notebooks have been arranged depending on the Machine Learning problem you want to develop:
- Classification:
  - CNN model only with TINTOlib images
  - Hybrid model (CNN+MLP) with TINTOlib images and tabular dataset
- Regression:
  - Hybrid model (CNN+MLP) with TINTOlib images and tabular dataset
